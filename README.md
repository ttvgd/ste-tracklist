# [Saint Etienne Tracklist](https://ttvgd.github.io/ste-tracklist/)

The Saint Etienne Trackless is an attempt to list all tracks by Saint Etienne, Sarah Cracknell and most collaborations. Everything is sorted alphabetically and according to track durations. This includes alternative versions and remixes.

For each variant, the primary releases are shown. Please notice that CDs are preferred over vinyl when possible. Promos are only referred to when they contain unique tracks or they were released only in this format at that time.

Reissues are only listed if they are "Deluxe Editions" or "Anniversary Edtions". Later reissues of Deluxe Editions are only listed if there are other tracks or changes.

All compilation albums are included.

## Sources

For more details regarding the releases, se this [list](releases.md). The primary source for releases and tracks is [Discogs](https://discogs.com) but of course [Saint Etienne Disco](https://saintetiennedisco.com) has been invaluable.

## About track durations

Track durations can be a challenge. Often durations include several seconds of silence at the end of the track. This can easily make tracks that are actually the same appear different. When possible, I have checked the digital editions of tracks in my possesion for the actual durations. This means that you will find tracks where the duration I list is not necessary similar to what is either printed on the album or what your preferred streaming app, player of digital files state, at Discogs or Saint Etienne Disco. Then again, only tracks that seem similar but with slight differences have been checked in detail, all other track durations are given as stated. I have also tried to take into considation any intro or outro samples or other artifacts that might appear.

## Sorting

Pedantic corner: Sorting is done according to the actual spelling, which means that "a" and "the" are part of the sorting.
