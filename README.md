# Saint Etienne Tracklist

The Saint Etienne Trackless is an attempt to list all tracks by Saint Etienne, Sarah Cracknell and most collaborations. Everything is sorted alphabetically and according to track durations. This includes alternative versions and remixes.

For each variant, the primary releases are shown. Please notice that CDs are preferred over vinyl when possible. Promos are only referred to if they contain unique tracks or it is the first time a specific variant was released.

## Sources

For more details regarding the releases, se this [list](albums.md). The primary source for albums and tracks is [Discogs](https://discogs.com) but of course [Saint Etienne Disco](https://saintetiennedisco.com) has been invaluable.

## About track durations

Track durations can be a challenge. Often durations include several seconds of silence at the end of the track. This can easily make tracks that are actually the same appear different. When possible, I have checked the digital editions of tracks in my possesion for the actual durations. This means that you will find tracks where the duration I list is not necessary similar to what is either printed on the album or what your preferred streaming app or player of digital files state. I have also tried to take into considation any intro or outro samples or other artifacts that might appear.

## Sorting

Pedantic corner: Sorting is done according to the actual spelling, which means that "a" and "the" are part of the sorting. If you don't like it, wellâ€¦
